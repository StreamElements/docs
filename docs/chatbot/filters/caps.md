# Caps

The Caps filter helps manage the use of capital letters in chat messages. It checks the number and percentage of capital letters in a message and compares them with the set limits. If a message violates these limits, the filter takes action according to the configured settings.

### Supported Settings

- `Timeout duration`: This is the duration (in seconds) for which a user will be timed out if their message violates the capital letters limits.
- `Excluded user groups`: These are the user groups that are exempt from the caps filter. Messages from users in these groups will not be checked by the filter.
- `Custom timeout message`: This is the message that will be displayed when a user is timed out due to a violation of the capital letters limits. This message can be customized to provide specific information about the violation and the timeout.
- `Maximum amount`: This is the maximum number of capital letters allowed in a message. If a message contains more capital letters than this limit, it will be flagged by the filter.
- `Minimum characters`: This is the minimum number of characters a message must have before the filter checks for a violation. If a message contains fewer characters than this limit, it will not be checked by the filter.
- `Maximum percent`: This is the maximum percentage of a message that can be capital letters. If the percentage of capital letters in a message exceeds this limit, it will be flagged by the filter.
