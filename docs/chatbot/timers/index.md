# Timers

Chatbot timers are automated messages or actions that occur at specified intervals during a live stream. They serve to remind viewers about certain aspects of the stream, such as rules or upcoming events, and can also be used to automatically execute commands at regular intervals.

### Settings

Each timer can be configured with multiple messages, which will be cycled through each time the timer is activated. Timers can be set to run both while live and offline, or can be configured to run only in one of these states.

The frequency of each timer can be set in minutes, determining how often it will be activated. Additionally, a minimum amount of chat lines that must be sent in the interval for the timer to be activated can be set, ensuring the timer only runs when chat activity is high enough.
