# Chat Alerts Module

## Overview

The Chat Alerts module is a powerful feature of the StreamElements chatbot that automatically posts messages in your Twitch chat when specific events occur. This helps streamers acknowledge viewer actions, enhance engagement, and keep the community informed about important stream events.

## Usage

Chat Alerts are triggered automatically when configured events happen during your stream. No manual commands are required to activate them.

## Examples

1. Follower Alert:
   ```
   New follower hype! Welcome to the stream, @NewFollower123! Thanks for joining our community!
   ```

2. Subscription Alert:
   ```
   @Subscriber456 just subscribed for 3 months! Thank you for your continued support!
   ```

## Parameters

Chat Alerts can be customized for various events. Here are some of the key parameters:

- **Event Type**: The specific action that triggers the alert (e.g., follow, subscription, raid)
- **Message**: The text that appears in chat when the event occurs
- **Cooldown**: Optional delay between alerts to prevent spam
- **Minimum Threshold**: Optional minimum value for events like donations or bit cheers

1. Access your StreamElements dashboard
2. Navigate to the Chatbot section
