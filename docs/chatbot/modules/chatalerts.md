## Overview

The Chat Alerts module is a powerful feature of the StreamElements chatbot that automatically posts messages in your Twitch chat when specific events occur. This helps streamers acknowledge viewer actions, enhance engagement, and keep the community informed about important stream events.

## Usage

Chat Alerts are triggered automatically when configured events happen during your stream. No manual commands are required to activate them.

## Examples

   ```
