# Bingo

### Description

The StreamElements emote bingo module is an interactive chat game. In this game, a bingo card is generated with a variety of emotes.

**How the game works:**

1. The game begins when a moderator initiates the command `!bingo <twitch/bttv/ffz/7tv/all> points`.
2. The module picks a single emote from the specified platform(s).
3. The chat users have to find the correct emote.
4. The game ends when a user puts the correct emote in the chat, and they are considered the winner.
