# !contest

<PlatformBadges supported={[ 'Twitch' ]} />

## Overview

The `!contest` command allows anyone in chat to quickly check the status and details of the currently active **betting contest**. It displays the contest question, the available betting options, and the remaining time to place bets.

**Note:** This command *checks* the status of an active contest. To *start* a new betting contest, moderators must use the **StreamElements Dashboard**.

## Usage

To check the active contest details, simply type the command in chat:

```streamelements
!contest
```

## Examples

<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'user', message: '!contest' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: '@User, the current contest is "Will I clutch this round?". You can !bet for yes, no. Betting ends in 3 mins 15 secs' }
]} />

<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'user', message: '!contest' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: '@User, there is no active contest.' }
]} />

## Configuration

*   The `!contest` command requires the **Betting module** to be active. Enable and configure it in your **StreamElements Dashboard** under `Chatbot` -> `Modules`.
*   The command response reflects the settings of the currently active contest (question, options, duration) configured by the streamer/moderator via the dashboard.

## Related Commands

*   [`!bet`](bet.mdx): Used by viewers to place bets on the active contest.
