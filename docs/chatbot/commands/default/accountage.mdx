# !accountage Command

<PlatformBadges supported={[ 'Twitch' ]} />

## Overview

The `!accountage` command allows users to check the creation date (age) of a Twitch account. This tool is particularly useful for moderators to verify user authenticity or determine eligibility for certain privileges based on account age.

## Usage

To use the command, type `!accountage` followed by an optional username. If no username is provided, it checks the account age of the user running the command.

```streamelements
!accountage [username]
```

## Examples

<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'moderator', usernameOverride: 'ModUser', message: '!accountage StreamElements' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: '@ModUser, StreamElements was created 10 years 2 months 28 days 7 hours ago.' }
]} />

<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'user', usernameOverride: 'ViewerBob', message: '!accountage' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: '@ViewerBob, your account was created 3 years 5 months 12 days 4 hours ago.' }
]} />

## Parameters

*   `[username]` (Optional): The Twitch username of the account you want to check. If omitted, the command checks the account age of the user who issued the command.

## Configuration

This command requires a connection to Twitch to fetch the account creation date. Ensure your StreamElements bot account is properly linked to Twitch.

## Aliases

The `!accountage` command has the following default aliases:

*   `!accage`
*   `!created`

These aliases can be used interchangeably with the main command.
