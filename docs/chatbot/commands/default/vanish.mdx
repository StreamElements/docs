# !vanish

<PlatformBadges supported={[ 'Twitch' ]} />

## Overview

The `!vanish` command allows chatters to temporarily time themselves out for 1 second. On platforms like Twitch, this has the effect of clearing their recent messages from the chat window for other users.

## Usage

To use the `!vanish` command, simply type it in the chat:

```streamelements
!vanish
```

## Examples

<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'user', message: '!vanish' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: 'StreamElements timed out [User] for 1 second.' }
]} />

## Configuration

*   This command is typically enabled by default.
*   Its functionality relies on the bot having timeout permissions (usually inherent).
*   The command can be enabled/disabled or have its permissions changed in the `Chatbot` -> `Chat Commands` -> `Default Commands` section of the StreamElements dashboard.
