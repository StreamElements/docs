# !when

<PlatformBadges supported={[ 'Twitch' ]} />

## Overview

The `!when` command allows viewers to check the status of **their most recent song request** in the media request queue. It typically provides the song's position in the queue and an estimated time until it plays.

## Usage

To check the status of your last song request:

```streamelements
!when
```

## Examples

<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'user', message: '!when' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: '@User, your song "The Best Song Ever" is at #4 in the queue and will play in approximately 12 minutes' } // Output varies
]} />

<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'user', message: '!when' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: '@User, your song "Currently Playing" is at #1 in the queue and is playing right now' } // Output varies
]} />

<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'user', message: '!when' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: '@User, you do not have a song in the queue.' } // Output varies
]} />
