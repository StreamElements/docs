# !slots

<PlatformBadges supported={[ 'Twitch' ]} />

## Overview

The `!slots` command allows viewers to play a simple slot machine game in your chat. Users bet a certain amount of loyalty points and have a chance to win a multiple of their bet back based on matching emotes.

## Usage

To play the slot machine:

```streamelements
!slots <bet>
```

## Examples

<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'user', message: '!slots 100' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: '@User you got Kappa | Kappa | Keepo and lost your 100 points LUL' } // Output varies
]} />

<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'user', message: '!slots 500' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: '@User you got Kappa | Kappa | Kappa and won 1500 points PogChamp' } // Output varies
]} />

## Parameters

*   `<bet>` (Required): The amount of loyalty points the user wants to bet. This must be a positive integer and within the configured minimum/maximum bet limits.

## Configuration

Streamers can customize the `!slots` game through the **Slots module** settings on the StreamElements dashboard (`Chatbot` -> `Modules`):

*   **Module Toggle:** Enable or disable the entire `!slots` game.
*   **System Rigging:** Adjust the payout percentage. A value lower than 100% means viewers are statistically likely to lose points over time, while a value higher than 100% means they are likely to gain points. The default is often set to ensure a house edge. *(Example: 200% in the provided image)*
*   **Minimum Points:** Set the minimum number of loyalty points a viewer must have to play the slot machine. *(Example: 100 points in the image)*
*   **Emotes:** Choose which emotes will act as the symbols on the slot machine reels. *(Examples from image: Kappa, PogChamp, BibleThump, OpieOP, 4Head)*
*   **Cooldowns:**
    *   **User Cooldown:** The minimum time (in seconds) a specific user must wait before playing again. *(Example: 60 seconds in the image)*
    *   **Global Cooldown:** The minimum time (in seconds) before *anyone* can use the `!slots` command again after it's been used. *(Example: 0 seconds in the image)*
*   **Win Message:** Customize the message displayed when a viewer wins. Available arguments: `{user}`, `{points}`, `{emotes}`, `{pointsname}`. *(Example from image: `@​{user} you got {emotes} and won {points} ${pointsname} PogChamp //`)*
*   **Lose Message:** Customize the message displayed when a viewer loses. Available arguments: `{user}`, `{points}`, `{emotes}`, `{pointsname}`. *(Example from image: `@​{user} you got {emotes} and lost your {points} ${pointsname} LUL`)*

:::important
The **Loyalty system** must also be active for the `!slots` command to function, as it relies on loyalty points.
