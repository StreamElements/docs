# !voteskip

<PlatformBadges supported={[ 'Twitch', 'YouTube', 'Trovo', 'Kick' ]} />

## Overview

The `!voteskip` command allows viewers to vote towards skipping the currently playing song or video in the StreamElements media request queue. If enough votes are cast (based on streamer configuration), the current item is skipped.

## Usage

To cast a vote to skip the current media:

```streamelements
!voteskip
```

## Examples

<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'user', message: '!voteskip' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: '@User Skip requested! Current song will be skipped in 4 more votes!' } // Output varies based on votes needed
]} />

<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'user', message: '!voteskip' }, // Assuming this is the final vote needed
  { persona: 'bot', message: '@User Vote to skip successful! Skipping to the next media request.' }
]} />
