# !votekick

<PlatformBadges supported={[ 'Twitch' ]} />

## Overview

The `!votekick` command initiates a community vote to temporarily remove (timeout) a user from the chat. This allows viewers to participate in moderation by collectively deciding if a user should be kicked for a period.

**Important:** By default, only users with **Moderator** permission level or higher can use this command to *start* a vote.

## Usage

To start a vote to kick a user:

```streamelements
!votekick <username> [duration]
```

## Examples

**Start a votekick for "DisruptiveUser" with the default vote duration:**
<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'moderator', message: '!votekick DisruptiveUser' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: 'Vote started to kick DisruptiveUser! Type !yes or !no to vote. (Vote ends in 60s)' } // Output varies based on settings
]} />

**Start a votekick for "RuleBreaker" with a 2-minute vote duration:**
<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'moderator', message: '!votekick RuleBreaker 2m' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: 'Vote started to kick RuleBreaker! Type !yes or !no to vote. (Vote ends in 120s)' } // Output varies based on settings
]} />

## Parameters

*   `<username>` (Required): The exact username of the user to potentially kick.
*   `[duration]` (Optional): The length of time the *voting period* should last. 
    *   If not specified, uses the default duration set in the module configuration.
    *   Can be specified in seconds (`s`), minutes (`m`), or hours (`h`) (e.g., `90s`, `3m`).
    *   Note: This is the duration for voting, *not* the kick/timeout duration if the vote passes.

## Configuration

*   Requires the **Votekick module** to be enabled (`Chatbot` -> `Modules`).
*   Moderators configure settings in the **Votekick module** on the Dashboard:
    *   Enable/disable the module.
    *   Set the default **Vote Duration**.
    *   Set the required **Minimum Votes** for the vote to be considered valid.
    *   Define the **Vote Threshold** (percentage of `!yes` votes needed to pass).
    *   Set the **Timeout Duration** (how long the user is kicked if the vote passes).
    *   Establish **Cooldowns** (global and per-user for starting votes).
