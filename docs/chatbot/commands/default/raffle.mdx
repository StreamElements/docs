# !raffle

## Overview

The `!raffle` command allows streamers and moderators to create interactive raffles with multiple winners. This feature engages viewers by giving them a chance to win prizes or recognition during the stream.

## Usage

```streamelements
!raffle <amount> <duration>
```
* `<amount>`: Required. The total reward (pot) for the raffle, distributed among winners.
* `<duration>`: Required. The duration of the raffle in seconds.

## Examples

**Start a raffle with a 100 point reward lasting 60 seconds:**
<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'moderator', message: '!raffle 100 60' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: 'The Multi-Raffle for 100 points will end in 60 Seconds. Enter by typing "!join"' }
]} />

**Create a longer raffle with a larger reward:**
<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'moderator', message: '!raffle 500 180' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: 'The Multi-Raffle for 500 points will end in 180 Seconds. Enter by typing "!join"' }
]} />


## Parameters
