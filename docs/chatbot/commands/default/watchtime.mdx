# !watchtime

<PlatformBadges supported={[ 'Twitch' ]} />

## Overview

The `!watchtime` command allows viewers to check how long they've accumulated watching the current channel. This feature requires the Loyalty system to be active and configured to track watch time.

## Usage

To check watch time:

```streamelements
!watchtime [username]
```

## Examples

<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'user', message: '!watchtime' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: '@User has spent 2 hours and 15 minutes watching StreamerName!' } // Format may vary
]} />

<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'user', message: '!watchtime LoyalViewer' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: 'LoyalViewer has spent 1 day 5 hours and 30 minutes watching StreamerName!' } // Format may vary
]} />

## Parameters

*   `[username]` (Optional): The username of the viewer whose watch time you want to check. If omitted, it defaults to the user issuing the command.

## Configuration

*   Requires the **Loyalty system** to be active (`Loyalty` -> `Loyalty Settings`).
