# !filesay

<PlatformBadges supported={[ 'Twitch', 'YouTube', 'Trovo', 'Kick' ]} />

## Overview

The `!filesay` command allows streamers and moderators to execute multiple commands or messages stored in a text file hosted at a public URL. Each line in the text file is sent as a separate command/message to the chat. This is extremely useful for performing bulk actions, such as banning multiple users listed in a file.

## Usage

To execute the commands/messages from a file URL:

```streamelements
!filesay <url>
```

**Important:**
*   By default, only users with **Super Moderator** permission level or higher can use this command.
*   The URL must point to a **raw text file** (e.g., a Pastebin raw link, a GitHub raw file link).
*   Each line in the file will be executed as if typed directly into chat. Ensure the commands are valid (e.g., `!ban username`).
*   There might be rate limits on how many lines can be processed quickly.

## Examples

**Example File (`https://pastebin.com/raw/examplebans`):**
```text
/ban BotUser1 Spamming
/ban TrollAccount2 Being disruptive
/timeout AnotherUser 600 Repeat offences
```

**Using the command:**
<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'broadcaster', message: '!filesay https://pastebin.com/raw/examplebans' },
  // Bot output will vary based on the file contents and success of each command
  { persona: 'bot', message: 'Executing 3 lines from URL...' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: 'BotUser1 has been permanently banned from the chat.' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: 'TrollAccount2 has been permanently banned from the chat.' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: 'AnotherUser has been timed out for 600 seconds.' }
]} />

## Parameters

*   `<url>` (Required): The direct URL to a plain text file where each line contains a command or message to be sent.

## Configuration

*   No specific module needs to be enabled, but the command relies on the bot having the necessary permissions to execute the commands listed within the file (e.g., ban permissions).
*   The command's permission level can be adjusted under `Chatbot` -> `Chat Commands` -> `Default Commands`.

## Related Commands

*   [`!nuke`](nuke.mdx): Times out all users who recently chatted based on a specific phrase.
*   [`!nukeusername`](nukeusername.mdx): Times out all users whose usernames match a pattern.
