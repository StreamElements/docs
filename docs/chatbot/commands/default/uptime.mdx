# !uptime

<PlatformBadges supported={[ 'Twitch', 'YouTube', 'Trovo', 'Kick' ]} />

## Overview

The `!uptime` command allows viewers and moderators to check how long the current stream has been live. It's a simple yet useful tool for tracking stream duration.

## Usage

To check the stream duration, simply type the command in the chat:

```streamelements
!uptime
```

## Examples

<ChatExample messages={[
  { persona: 'user', message: '!uptime' },
  { persona: 'bot', message: '@StreamerName has been live for 2 hours 35 minutes and 10 seconds' } // Format may vary
]} />

## Configuration

*   This command relies on the bot having access to the stream's start time information.
*   The response format can often be customized in the default command settings (`Chatbot` -> `Chat Commands` -> `Default Commands` -> `!uptime`).
