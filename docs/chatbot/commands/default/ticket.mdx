# !ticket

<PlatformBadges supported={[ 'Twitch', 'YouTube', 'Trovo', 'Kick' ]} />

## Overview

The `!ticket` command allows viewers to purchase tickets for ongoing giveaways using their loyalty points. This command enables participation in raffles hosted through the StreamElements loyalty system.

:::info Important Note
By default, the `!ticket` command does **not** reply to the user to prevent chat spam during active giveaways. Streamers can enable confirmation messages by checking the "Send confirmation when buying tickets in chat" option in the giveaway settings on the StreamElements dashboard.
:::

## Usage

To purchase tickets, type `!ticket` in the chat, optionally followed by the number of tickets you wish to buy. If no number is specified, it defaults to purchasing one ticket.

**Syntax:**
```streamelements
!ticket [*number_of_tickets*]
```

## Examples

1.  **Buying a single ticket:**
    <ChatExample
        messages={[
            { persona: 'user', message: '!ticket' },
            { persona: 'bot', message: '@viewer, you successfully bought 1 ticket!', optional: true }
        ]}
    />

2.  **Buying multiple tickets:**
    <ChatExample
        messages={[
            { persona: 'user', message: '!ticket 5' },
            { persona: 'bot', message: '@viewer, you successfully bought 5 tickets!', optional: true }
        ]}
