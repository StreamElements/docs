# $(customapi) Variable

## Overview

The `$(customapi)` variable enables you to make HTTP requests to external APIs and display the responses directly in your stream's chat. This powerful feature allows you to integrate real-time data from various sources into your chat messages and commands.

## Usage

To use the `$(customapi)` variable, include it in your chat message or command response followed by the URL you want to request:

```
$(customapi URL)
```

Replace *URL* with the actual API endpoint you want to call.

```
