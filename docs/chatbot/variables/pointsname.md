# $(pointsname) Variable

## Overview

The `$(pointsname)` variable is a dynamic way to display the current name of your stream's loyalty currency in chat messages or commands. It automatically updates to reflect your custom points system name, providing a flexible solution for referencing your loyalty program.

## Usage

Insert `$(pointsname)` into your chat messages or commands where you want the loyalty currency name to appear. The chatbot will automatically replace it with your actual loyalty points name.

## Examples

1. Informing viewers about earning points:

```
Earn more $(pointsname) by watching the stream!
```

Output (assuming your currency is named "memecoins"):
```
Earn more memecoins by watching the stream!
```

2. Creating a custom command to check points balance:

```
!cmd add points Your current $(pointsname) balance is $(user.points).
```

Output (for a user with 500 points):
```
Your current memecoins balance is 500.
```
